# FileToBase64
Basic Windows Application to Convert a File to Base64 string using C#.

Drag and Drop the File you want to do your nuclear tests on.

this app has some feutures too like splitting base64 string after a number into 2 parts and get the base64 string length and a funny message when you quit the app ._.

Releases: [V2](https://github.com/MadLadDZ/FileToBase64/files/3340855/V2.zip "Releases")



I don't see why anyone would use this application as there are so many and better apps out there. 
I'm uploading this to github to archive my progess of learning C#
