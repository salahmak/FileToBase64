# FileToBase64
Basic Windows Application to Convert a File to Base64 string using C#.

Drag and Drop the File you want to convert and either Paste the Base64 string to your clipboard OR save it to a text.

Releases: [V1](https://github.com/MadLadDZ/FileToBase64/files/3331973/V1.zip "Releases")



I don't see why anyone would use this application as there are so many and better apps out there. 
I'm uploading this to github to archive my progess of learning C#
