# FileToBase64
Basic Windows Application to Convert a File to Base64 using C#.
Drag and Drop the File you can't to convert and either Paste the Base64 string to clipboard OR save it to a file.

To Use: open 'File To Base64.sln' and compile.


I don't see why anyone would use this application as there are so many and better apps out there. 
I'm uploading this to github to archive my progess of learning C#
